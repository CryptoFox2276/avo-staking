# Get started

# Requirement
- AVO token staking, 
- the yield depends on the staking period (month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months) and the number of referrals of 1 and 2 levels, the more of them, the higher the yield of staking, however, the maximum APY that a user can receive is 60%.
- the possibility of partner staking similar to the daomars.com project, where the user stakes a partner project token and receives yield in AVO tokens. (That is, the ability to stack partner tokens)
